# The Mock-Turtle's Song Instrumental Extraction

A (scrapped) attempt to extract the backing for "The Mock-Turtle's Song from the movie "Alice in Wonderland" (1999), composed by Richard Hartley.


Copied from an [answer by sonnix_slacktide on the MatLab Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/1qrpzf/comment/cdfx67l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with minor tweaks.


I tried doing this in MatLab because I thought it'd be cool to get the audio straight from the movie soundtrack, but unfortunately it sounded awful, no matter the parameters I tried. I think it didn't work as well as I'd hoped because the instrumental is kind of orchestral, so there are, well, many instruments in it, some of whose pitches overlap with the range of human voices.


Probably someone better at signal processing could have gotten some usable audio in this way, but I had to give in and transcribe the tune by ear on MuseScore. That worked though!
